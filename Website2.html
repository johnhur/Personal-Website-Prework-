<h4> I am hungry for any opportunities for growth intellectually and professionally. With that being said, I can hardly contain my excitement to learn web development alongside other smart and dedicated gSchool students! Besides music, some of my interests lie in healthcare and biotechnology. Once I refine my developing chops, I wish to combine my knowledge and skils in web development, healthcare, and biotechnology to bring pragmatic software solutions to the complex array of issues that the human body and the environment face in the 21st century.
